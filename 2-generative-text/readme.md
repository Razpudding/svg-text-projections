# Generative Text

## Plan

- Have artist create a taxonomy of meaning for the words used in his texts
- Structure data to allow for easy manipulation and selection
- Create an interface that allows artist to play around with generative features

## interface
- Host a simple js+html+css interface (on vizhub?)
- X-number of dropdown menus for each textual dimension
- Y-number of generated texts in simple html
- Additional features like randomization, length settings (total length but also lenght of sentences)
