# Exploring SVG text projections

In this experiment I'll explore how text can be oriented alongside geometric shapes. This is related to an art project I'm cooperating in :)

## Experiments

### Align text along a path
Using the svgjs lib I've been able to align text to a path quite easily. There are some downsides though:

- Drawing SVG paths is a bit annoying. I;ve been using [this online tool](https://yqnn.github.io/svg-path-editor/) but it's quite tedious for more complex shapes.
- It's hard to orient the text per line segment in the current setup. Ideally, you would create a segment, write text to fit it and then move on to the next segment. Each segment should be draggable.
- Any symbol made out of several paths instead of one continuation of line segments will be hard to map text to.

### Animation
I've played around a bit with svgjs' animation options. They work really well for text. Something I still want to try is moving the text along a shape. This should be doable for a simple triangle but will prob be nearly impossible for any shape made out of several paths.

Start thinking about the ritual as a game

A game in which the rules are not clear

take a step, jump. 

Build a tent. With rope and bed sheets and everything you can find

Scream: THIS IS AN INVITATION

Start sleeping under art in public spaces.

Stare at the moon all night long

Sit on a chair and face the highway whilst the city wakes up

Give rooms arms, legs and eyes

Give 10 children, 10 crayons. One crayon each.  Exhibit their findings

Politicise the jigsaw puzzle,

enter the livingroom.

create integrated environments

consisting of ritual objects, spatial adaptations

and LIVING PEOPLE

waar zit het rituele potentieel in ons dagelijks bestaan?

A ritual space

In which objects and people are in constant communications

invite people to PROTEST

find 50 words for silence

think of 1 symbol for loneliness

move, paint, sit, sing, scream, write

Talk to the DEAD and the LIVING

call on the collective 

Call for collaboration

to wait, to be bored, to play, 

give a voice to the voiceless

speak without a tongue

uuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
