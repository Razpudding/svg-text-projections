# Developing the work into a creative tool used for brainstorming and discussion



## Steps
- Some refactoring: Artist can now edit settings in the settings file.


## Features

### Done
- There will be a text which contains all of the words in the categories
- Each card will be composed of words within one category
- One word withing the category will be displayed in the middle of the card at random
- The animation duration should be changeable at the top of the code by the artist
- The whole circle of cards should rotate once, slowly, to highlight each card once on top
- Some settings can be changed by hand by altering the code. These will be listed as variables at the top of the code for the artist to manipulate
- The number of cards should be changeable. 
- One option should be to have the words in the middle of each card come from one category instead of the card's category. That way a category can be highlighted.

### In Progress
- One word per card at random should be bigger within the textpath and colored differently
- The text on a card should keep flowing, even when theres no more space left. It can run continuously, this should be changeable.
- The text in the middle should be changeable and will autoscale to fit the available width
- The final work will be a website, where the artist can copy paste texts, change some settings, and then a visualization will be generated.
