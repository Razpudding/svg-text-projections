- [Vizhub svgjs test](https://vizhub.com/Razpudding/86bd2b28c4034086a4112794a57e66f7?edit=files&file=index.html)
- Generative SVG art?
    + Recognize words in text, generate shapes for the words (like chair ⑁) using a library, render text on the words.

## Options for Artist
- Create and orient texts yourself, static, 2D -> Illustrator
- Draw paths and use my custom software to add texts to them. Static, 2D -> My Code
- Animate text along Paths, Animated, 2D. also possible to zoom in following text being written then zoom out to see the whole -> My Code
- combine text with bitmap visuals -> VJ software
- Overlays -> Illustrator
- Anything interactive -> My Code
