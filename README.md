# svg-text-projections
Some experiments around text projections for an art project

## Notes
- Use color from words in email, these words are central
- Start with a question, generate 10 random words (separate exp)
- Complete the shape, without animation. All words in all rectangles, then select random words for center
- Play with selection of sentences versus words, versus meaningful words
- Poetry in the center of the constellation is the key to the whole thing
- What is the relationship between the individual and the whole during a ritual (placement within a space)

## Vision
- Each card will represent an artistic discipine
- A card will have rectangular shape made out of text describing the discipline
- A card will have a central word signifing the discipline
- A random element added to the work would be nice, like text added to the middle randomly composed of words in the description texts
- Cards should be oriented in an overarching structure
- It would be great if the camera was zoomed in on the top of the circle and cards flew by as their descriptions shaped the rectangles. Then the animation zooms out to reveal the superstructure

### Choreohraphy
- First there is just a text, an invitation
- The text dissapears and parts of the text start to create rectangular shapes (cards)
- Each card represents an element (discipline/term/question)

## Options for Artist
- Create and orient texts yourself, static, 2D -> Illustrator
- Draw paths and use my custom software to add texts to them. Static, 2D -> My Code
- Animate text along Paths, Animated, 2D. also possible to zoom in following text being written then zoom out to see the whole -> My Code
- combine text with bitmap visuals -> VJ software
- Overlays -> Illustrator
- Anything interactive -> My Code
- If you want to integrate a screen a lot more becomes possible. Like the words you say appearing on a projected screen behind you
